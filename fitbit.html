                <h5 class = "fitbit-desc">Mindful Steps is a project that focuses on increasing the health of veterns through walking and Tai Chi.
                    They use an algorithm to find the ideal number of steps these people should be taking a day, and use FitBits to monitor them. 
                    The current website for this project is not user friendly and has been getting low interaction from their audience.  
                </h5>
                <h2 class="fitbit-header">Solution</h2>
                <h5 class = "fitbit-desc">A redesigned desktop and mobile friendly website was created</h5>

                <h6 class = fitbit-info>To begin this discovery, I met with stakeholders and SMEs to gather information about the target audience for this project. </h6>
                <h6 class="fitbit-insights"> I identified our target audience to be:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Age: 50 years plus</li>
                        <li>Gender: More male than female</li>
                        <li>Primary Location: Boston VA</li>
                        <li>Co-morbid conditions: COPD, CHF, Diabetes</li>

                </div>
                <h6 class = fitbit-info>I then launched 5 interviews with individuals who fit the target audience, and asked key questions pertaining to 
                    website usability, painpoints, and optimal structure.</h6>
                <h6 class="fitbit-insights"> Key insights I gained from these interviews include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Many individuals do not prefer dropdowns, accordians, or other elements that require interaction.</li>
                        <li>The easiest website designs to learn have consistent structure with other websites they use (AARP, Google, Facebook)</li>
                        <li>Visual and text heiarchies are necessary to understand the organization of the websites</li>

                <h6 class = fitbit-info>Personas were created, and the user needs identified.</h6>
                <h6 class="fitbit-insights"> Top User Needs:
                    <ul>
                        <li>I need a website that does not require a lot of interaction, as this can be confusing and lead to missed information</li>
                        <li>I need a website that is visually pleasing so that I want to revisit it.</li>
                        <li>I need a website that has clear information, so that I can easily find what I am looking for without getting frustrated.</li>

                <h6 class = fitbit-info>Many of the web pages were redesigned and presented to the stakeholders. The full prototype cannot be shared due to privacy concerns.</h6>
                <h6 class="fitbit-insights"> Design Decisions:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The aim was to keep the redesign as similar to the original as possible, as resources for the redesign were limited. </li>
                        <li>A clearer page hierarchy was created, included a simplified header, creation of a footer, and decluttering of links.</li>
                        <li>The research team needed a weekly motivator for their participants, so a star system was created and emphasized at the top of the page.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h6 class="fitbit-insights"> Design Decisions:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The aim was to keep the mobile design as similar to the desktop design as possible, so that users did not have to relearn a new platform and felt comfortable with using the site on smaller screens. </li>
                        <li>The desktop's three column grid was changed to a two column grid, so that the content appears large enough on smaller devices to be usable.</li>
                        <li>The research team needed a weekly motivator for their participants, so a star system was created and emphasized at the top of the page.</li>
